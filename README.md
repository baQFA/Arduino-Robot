# Arduino-Robot
An Arduino single plate robot setup with the non-mechanical parts to print yourself using a 3D printer.

The current Arduino robot setup uses an 
- Arduino Uno R3 board, 
- 2 SG90 servo motors, a 
- WS2812B LED strip, and a 
- Canon EOS 450D DSLR camera with a 
- Canon EF-S 24mm f/2.8 STM lens. 


All printable parts are printed in PETG to withstand common disinfection solutions (e.g., ethanol).
